### So, what's this Slic3r?

Slic3r is mainly a **toolpath generator** for 3D printers: it reads 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF, 3MF) and it converts them into **G-code** instructions for 3D printers. But it does much more than that, see the [features list](#features) below.

Slic3r was born in **2011** within the RepRap community and thanks to its high configurability became the swiss-army knife for 3D printing. It served as a platform for experimenting several **new ideas that later became technology standards**, such as multiple extruders, brim, variable-height layers, per-object settings, modifiers, post-processing scripts, G-code macros and more. Despite being based on volunteer efforts, Slic3r is still pushing the boundaries of 3D printing.

Slic3r is:

* **Open:** it is totally **open source** and it's **independent from any commercial company** or printer manufacturer. We want to keep 3D printing open and free.
* **Compatible:** it supports all the known G-code dialects (Marlin, Repetier, Mach3, LinuxCNC, Machinekit, Smoothie, Makerware, Sailfish).
* **Advanced:** many configuration options allow for fine-tuning and full control. While novice users often need just few options, Slic3r is mostly used by advanced users.
* **Community-driven:** new features or issues are discussed in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/issues). Join our collaborative effort and help improve it!
* **Robust:** the codebase includes more than 1,000 unit and regression tests, collected in 6 years of development.
* **Modular:** the core of Slic3r is libslic3r, a C++ library that provides a granular API and reusable components.
* **Embeddable:** a complete and powerful command line interface allows to use Slic3r from the shell or to integrate it in server-side applications.
* **Powerful:** see the list below!

See the [project homepage](http://slic3r.org/) at slic3r.org for more information.

### <a name="features"></a>Features

(Most of these are also available in the command line interface.)

* **G-code generation** for FFF/FDM printers;
* **conversion** between STL, OBJ, AMF, 3MF and POV formats;
* **auto-repair** of non-manifold meshes (and ability to re-export them);
* **SVG export** of slices;
* built-in **USB/serial** host controller, supporting **multiple simultaneous printers** each one with a spool queue;
* **OctoPrint integration** (send to printer);
* built-in **projector and host for DLP printers**;
* tool for **cutting meshes** in multiple solid parts with visual preview (also in batch using a grid);
* tool for **extruding 2.5D TIN meshes**.

### What language is it written in?

The core parts of Slic3r are written in C++11, with multithreading. The graphical interface is still mostly written in Perl, but we're gradually porting it to C++ (want to help?). The goal is to port everything to C++.

### How to install?

You can download a precompiled package from [slic3r.org](http://slic3r.org/) (releases) or from [dl.slicr3r.org](http://dl.slic3r.org/dev/) (automated builds).

### How can I invoke Slic3r using the command line?

    Usage: slic3r.pl [ OPTIONS ] [ file.stl ] [ file2.stl ] ...
    
        --help              Output this usage screen and exit
        --version           Output the version of Slic3r and exit
        --save <file>       Save configuration to the specified file
        --load <file>       Load configuration from the specified file. It can be used
                            more than once to load options from multiple files.
        -o, --output <file> File to output gcode to (by default, the file will be saved
                            into the same directory as the input file using the
                            --output-filename-format to generate the filename.) If a
                            directory is specified for this option, the output will
                            be saved under that directory, and the filename will be
                            generated by --output-filename-format.

      Non-slicing actions (no G-code will be generated):
        --repair            Repair given STL files and save them as <name>_fixed.obj
        --cut <z>           Cut given input files at given Z (relative) and export
                            them as <name>_upper.stl and <name>_lower.stl
        --split             Split the shells contained in given STL file into several STL files
        --info              Output information about the supplied file(s) and exit

      GUI options:
        --gui               Forces the GUI launch instead of command line slicing (if you
                            supply a model file, it will be loaded into the plater)
        --no-gui            Forces the command line slicing instead of gui. 
                            This takes precedence over --gui if both are present.
        --autosave <file>   Automatically export current configuration to the specified file
    
      Output options:
        --output-filename-format
                            Output file name format; all config options enclosed in brackets

        --export-svg        Export a SVG file containing slices instead of G-code.
        -m, --merge         If multiple files are supplied, they will be composed into a single
                            print rather than processed individually.
    
      Printer options:
