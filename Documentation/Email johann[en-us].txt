Hello! johann,
I saw your open source project on RepRap: the Kossel mini.
I will build a new Mini Kossel portable delta robot 3D printer with your open source project.
And I am very interested in your proposal to offering free printed parts for Mini Kossel on the Github.
I'll keep my promise to you.

About the color of PLA,I think it would be Pink,I like the color.
My mailing address is 广东省潮州市湘桥区枫春路吉园街金潮集团 (JingChao Group Co., Ltd , Ji Yuan Jie , Feng Chun Lu , Guang Dong Sheng Chao Zhou Shi Xiang Qiao Qu ) . China Zip code:521011.

This is my father address,please fill in the Chinese part of the address.

I am a student, you provide free printing parts for me to reduce a lot of burden.
Thank you for your gift,I'll give you the same free package after making the mini Kossel.

Looking forward to your reply.
